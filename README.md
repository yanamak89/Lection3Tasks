# Lection3Tasks

- **Task 1:** Integrate your IDE with GIT.

- **Task 2:** Using your IDE, create a project with 5 files and push them to a remote repository.

- **Task 3:** Create several repositories with files from your previous projects of 2 types: public and private. For the repository with private access, grant access to 5 colleagues and the coach's assistant to receive code reviews from them.

- **Task 4:** Each of the 5 colleagues and the coach's assistant who receive access to your repository (see Task 3) must add a new branch, add several files to it, and commit them.

- **Task 5:** Perform the merging of the added branches and remove unnecessary ones.

- **Task 6 (teamwork!):** Create a team (2-3 students) calculator program. The first student creates a project/file/class where the program will be located and sends it using IDE tools to a remote server. Each subsequent student should clone the project to their computer, add their parts of the program, make commits, and push these changes to the remote server.
